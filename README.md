LATTE is a novel visual smart contract construction system on Ethereum to make smart contract development accessible to non-programmers. Specifically, it allows a user to construct a contract without writing Solidity code by manipulating visual objects in
a direct manipulation-based interface. Furthermore, LATTE interactively guides users and makes them aware of the cost (in units of Gas) of visual actions undertaken by them during
contract construction.

This work has been presented in [SIGMOD'20](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/assourav/papers/SIGMOD-20-LATTE.pdf).
